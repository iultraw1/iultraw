### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Tayfun.

I'm a freelance web developer / half-time musician.

I love to code something hard, I also like some cool musics as well.

Generally, I'm sharing some coding stuff in my YouTube channel. If you wanna check out then check out!

I also write some articles about web development. So if you interesting with that, you can read in here. But unfortunately, it is only turkish for now :/

As I mentioned it, I'm creating some semi-amateur musics as well, if you wanna listen my music you can checkout here

In 2008, I started with HTML and CSS. In 2011, I started to learn PHP and MySQL. While ago, I started to learn Javascript. My current passion is Javascript now. Since 2008, I developed a lot of web projects for my customers and my self. Once upon a time I also developed some cool mobile applications but not worth mention it.
